"""This is the pulsesim package of the quantum_logical library.

This package provides classes and functions for simulating quantum systems,
modes, and pulses within a quantum logical framework. It includes the following
main components:

- Hamiltonian: A class for representing Hamiltonians in quantum systems.
- QuantumSystem: A class for handling quantum systems.
- QuantumMode: A class for representing quantum modes.
- Pulse: A class for simulating quantum pulses.

Use these modules to build and simulate quantum mechanical systems and their
interactions through various pulses and modes.
