Motivation, hardware crowding + connectivity (SWAPs, high-fidelity 2Q gates, etc) -> transition into (1) SNAIL-coupling hardware architecture co-design. this paper is spiritual successor to corral paper, so we can talk about the short-comings of that paper here, ie how do we know what is the right size corral to use (previously we guesstimated)? More- in the first paper we showed that dense connectivity is better at reducing SWAPs (let's try again with better SWAP routing algorithms) but more importantly, we didn't account for the fact that we can't keep gate fidelities perfectly ideal. Now we have better analysis to make sure we are making appropriate tradeoff considerations)\n",
