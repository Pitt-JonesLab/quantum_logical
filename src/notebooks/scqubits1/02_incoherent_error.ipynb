        "The goal is to measure the closeness of a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map $\\mathcal{E} \\in C(\\mathcal{X})$ to a target unitary operation $\\mathcal{U} \\in C(\\mathcal{X})$, where $\\mathcal{U}[\\rho] = U\\rho U^\\dagger$ for some unitary matrix $U$. This measure of closeness is known as the *Gate Fidelity*.\n",
