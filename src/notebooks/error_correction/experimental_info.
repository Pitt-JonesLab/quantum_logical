all of these experiments should be run on a qutrit or higher but definitely not on a qubit
experiment 1:
begin by writing the hamiltonian with the third order linearity 
include the pulse term based on the pulse class that evan created. if needed see how he used it in his work 
make sure when you run the parallel computation function 
    (qutip you call it qt.parallel.parallel_map because that is how it is called)
find the optimal iswap 

run the iswap on the system and see how long it takes for the three wave and compare it to the five wave 


experiment 2: 
use the optimal iswap parameters that you find for the most beneficial of the mixing hamiltonians
replicate the erasure code that evan has and see if it gives the same expected results
    (when doing this make sure that you use the full hamiltonian and not just the conversion and gain hamiltonian
    that evan uses)
will have to use an encoded system 

experiment 3:
make sure that the code can detect when something happens to the system and gather fidelities that make sense 
gather info about the efficiency of the syndrome extraction
